        <h1>Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah? For real this time. This is it.</h1><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ff/9bc/6098962edd260c49d52d4b2b58d4df0b62-13-miles-morales-lede.rhorizontal.w700.jpg">

        <p>My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider, and for like 2 days, I've been the one and only Spider-Man. I think you know the rest. I finished my essay, saved a bunch of people, got hit by a drone (like Peter did), I did this with my dad (to remember my uncle), met my roommate finally, slapped a sticker where my dad's never gonna find it, and when I feel alone, like no one understands what I'm going through, I remember my friends who get it.</p>

        <h1>Why did I become a hero?</h1>

        <p>I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff, but I can. Anyone can wear the mask. You could wear the mask. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now. 'Cause I'm Spider-Man, and I'm not the only one. Not by a long shot."</p>
        <h1>What are my powers and abilites?</h1>
        <p>After a few hours, I gained the proportionate abilities of a spider after being bitten by a spider. Some of these powers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Superhuman Strength: I possess superhuman strength, making me capable of lifting at least 10 tons. My physical strength also extends into my legs, enabling me to be able to jump to a height of several stories in a single bound. Howerer, I have to pull my punches and kicks, otherwise, my blows would cause severe injures to a normal human.</li>
            <li>Superhuman Speed: I possess the proportionate speed of a spider, therefore I can run and move at speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. I was able to move fast enough to reach an airplane as it took off once.</li>
            <li>Wall-Crawling: Like a spider, I can cling to any surface using just my fingertips and feet.</li>
            <li>Spider-Sense: My spider-sense warns me when a threat is nearby.</li>

        </ul>
